#. Edit your buildout.cfg and add add the following to it::

    [buildout]
    ...

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will
take care of updating your system.

Check the box next to ``sc.banner`` and click the 'Activate' button.

.. Note::
    You may have to empty your browser cache and save your resource registries
    in order to see the effects of the product installation.

Usage
^^^^^

A Banner is a content type with the same behavior of the standard Link,
containing an aditional image field.

When accessing a Banner, you have two behaviors: if the user has permission to
edit the object, she will see the default view of the object with a status
message on top.

If the user has no permission to edit the object, she will be redirected to
the URL stored in the Banner.

A Banner should point to an external URL and only 'http' and 'https' schemes
are allowed by design.
